A gpsd logging and replication daemon.

Installation:

Install NodeJS and npm. Then run the following inside the agpsd directory:

npm install


Usage:

./server.js --listen=4711 --db=agpsd.db --upstream=localhost:2947 --downstream=someserver:4712

Take GPS input from the gpsd och agpsd running at localhost:2947 and
dump to the (sqlite) database mydb.db. Listen for incoming connections
(gpsd protocol) on 4711. Also try to connect to port 3712 on
someserver and send data to it using a role-reversed gpsd protocol
(client pretends to be server, server pretends to be client). All
arguments except upstream and downstream defaults to the values shown
above. Without upstream, no new data is appended to the database.
