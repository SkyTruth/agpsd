          <h1>Typical usage</h1>

<p>The typical usage of AGPSD is to send GPSD data over a intermittent
network connection from a vehicle to a server, and have the server serve
the last known data as well as history to clients. Currently the data
can be retrieved using the GPSD protocol and KML.</p>

<h1>Features</h1>

<p>AGPSD works like a GPSD router, with caching. It acts as both a GPSD
client and server, and stores all NMEA events in an SQLite database. In
addition to simply relaying data to clients, it supports replaying old
data, and replication of the log between AGPSD servers.</p>

<p>It can initiate connections for replication both from the receiving and
the sending end, enabling operation over networks with dynamic ip:s</p>

<p>AGPSD also acts as a web server and serves the recorded data as KML, as
well as an OpenLayers based user interface to browse said kml data.</p>
