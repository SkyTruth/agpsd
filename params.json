Currently the data\r\ncan be retrieved using the GPSD protocol and KML.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\nAGPSD works like a GPSD router, with caching. It acts as both a GPSD\r\nclient and server, and stores all NMEA events in an SQLite database. In\r\naddition to simply relaying data to clients, it supports replaying old\r\ndata, and replication of the log between AGPSD servers.\r\n\r\nIt can initiate connections for replication both from the receiving and\r\nthe sending end, enabling operation over networks with dynamic ip:s\r\n\r\nAGPSD also acts as a web server and serves the recorded data as KML, as\r\nwell as an OpenLayers based user interface to browse said kml data.\r\n\r\n# License\r\nGPL v 3\r\n\r\n# Author\r\n\r\nRedHog (Egil MÃ¶ller)"}
